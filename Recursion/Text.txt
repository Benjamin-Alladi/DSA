***Types of Recursion: (Parametric and Functional Recursion)

1. Head Recursion:
    Recursive call is the first statement of the function. There are no operations before the recursive call.

2. Tail Recursion:
    Recursive call is the last statement of the function. There are no operations after the recursive call.

3. Linear Recursion:
    The function calls itself for only once.
    Only 1 recursive call.
    Ex: print1toN, printNto1, Factorial.

4. Tree Recursion:
    Multiple Recursive calls.
    Ex: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs.


5. Direct Recursion:
    f()->f()->f().

6. Indirect Recursion:
    f()->g()->f().


***Types of Approaches:
1. IBH: Induction Base-Condition Hypothesis
2. Decision Tree

***Recursion cab be applied if you can identify:
1. Base-Condition.
2. Problem dividing into SubProblems. The code structure of subproblems and main problem should be same.
3. Combine and Return the results of subprolems.
